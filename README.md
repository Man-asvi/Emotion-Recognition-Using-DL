## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **emotion recognition system** using **deep learning techniques** to classify facial expressions into various emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **fear**, **surprise**, etc.

It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of facial expression images to learn spatial features and accurately predict emotions.
